  1. Enable Focus Mode 
  2. PowerShell Check notifiations every 15 minutes? 
  3. Pop up Summary Notification every 15 minutes? 
  4. Custom Focus Profiles (Registry looks capable - don't see in GUI) 

PInvoke to call System API to Enable/Disable Focus mode? 

Settings URI to turn on/off Focus Mode?
