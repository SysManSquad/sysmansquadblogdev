Okay, so you've gotten all of your OneDrive libraries you want syncing down to the PC, but you just finished the migration, closed a Team, or need to remove that Synced folder you had to recreate again. Well, no one told the OneDrive Client to un-sync the deleted site/document-library so it just throws an angry warning. Let's fix that. 

<!--more-->

## Identifying Use Case {#identifying}

In my personal case, I was hoping to find a way to Un-Sync a library from CLI or URL handler, or something to script against with a Proactive Remediation. Specifically, we had just finished a migration, and a site we meant to be **temporary** was now deleted. We had access to information like Site, Document Library, and Folder IDs for the folders we were trying to clear - the same kind of IDs you would use to make an **odopen://** link to [sync a library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/deploy-on-windows#auto-configure-sharepoint-site-synchronization). 

## Microsoft Documentation

OneDrive.exe has almost no documentation that I could find for any command line features, and when I asked Microsoft, they told me that the feature I asked for documentation about didn't exist. 

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large">![](image.png)</figure>
</div>

Well, that's..... not remotely useful.... and sort of inaccurate. 

See, OneDrive does not have any central list of OneDrive.exe params or commands that I could find, but you can see some examples around - like [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/plan-onedrive-enterprise#install-onedrive-on-windows-devices-by-using-scripting-methods), where they mention some random CLI Parameters for Silent Account Config, or those **odopen://** links from the [identifying section](#identifying) that basically pass through to **OneDrive.exe /URL:odopen://** .

## Compiled Documentation

After some searching around Microsoft Docs, random blog posts around the internet, strings searching, and some attempts at decompiling the executable, this was the whole list of command lines that I was able to find. Alternatively, feel free to jump right on to [building a solution](#building-a-solution) if you don't want to look over the parameters. 

Note: Some of these seem like they may have been related to OneDrive**SETUP**.exe - but in several cases, I also saw mentions of them where it seemed to be talking about the already installed app, or where I saw it showing up when I was searching for parameters. These may not actually be valid commands - I couldn't find any documentation from Microsoft. <figure class="wp-block-table alignwide">

### More Info or Feedback?

This is a list that is likely incomplete or may be referencing older versions of OneDrive sync clients. If you have any suggestions, please reach out at one of the addresses below and I will try to get this updated.

## Building a Solution {#building-a-solution}

Since you can use [odopen](odopen://sync/?)[://sync/?siteId....](odopen://sync/?siteId) to configure a new sync site, I was hoping I might be able to find a similar URI to De-Sync a site. From what I have found though, this is not currently built in.

However, I did find the config file for the OneDrive.exe client - and it seems to store it's configuration files in plaintext .ini files in **$Env:LocalAppData/Microsoft/OneDrive/Settings/$ClientTypeID/$ClientID** . Here is a partial sample of one of these files below, showing part of how different lines map to different synced folders and libraries. <figure class="wp-block-image alignwide">

![](https://i.imgur.com/HWj6rsM.png) </figure>

With a little bit of comparison and fiddling around, it seems that removing the relevant line from this config file will remove that directory from being synced by the OneDrive client. 

## Parsing the Config

One of the raw lines in that file looks like this


```powershell



If I break that up into what parameters those seem to be, and comment them


  ```powershell 
libraryScope = 
0 
c1b8b28878084aa3aa4692b15d1fa0d6

```


## Finishing the Solution

First we need to stop the OneDrive client so it will not modify the config files after we change then - which lines up nicely with **onedrive.exe /shutdown** from above. Then we will need to make the changes to the config files, and then start OneDrive back up again (preferably without popping up Explorer.exe for the user) - this lines up nicely with **OneDrive.exe /background** from above. 

One frustrating this is that this leaves any locally-synced files present on the disk, which can easily get confusing. Probably best to wrap this with some additional commands to unpin that directory from OneDrive sync, and free up space so that the dead Library isn't taking up that disk space. 

## Where is the Module

I wrapped up parsing this config file, and clearing it off the disk space, into a command in the Module OneDrive-Client, available on the [PSGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Onedrive-client) and [GitHub](https://github.com/PsychoData/Onedrive-Client). Here are a couple examples of it's use. 


```powershell
Install-Module -Name OneDrive-Client    
Get-ODClients | Get-ODSyncedLibraryConfig  | where {$_.SiteID -eq "f496b4697f1d4b968542d065c7dd261b"} | Remove-ODSyncedItemConfig
```



```powershell
Install-Module -Name OneDrive-Client    
 Get-ODClients | Get-ODSyncedLibraryConfig  | where {$_.SiteName -like "OldTeam"} | select -expandProperty SyncedFolders | where {$_.FolderName -eq 'OldDeadChannel'} | Remove-ODSyncedItemConfig
```
