I have a bad habit of leaving our Master VMs for Gold Images online, costing us money for no reason. 

I can set up an idle shutdown, but sometimes it's doing something important, and I just forgot about it. I need some kind of Ping/Reminder to say "hey! You left this on! was that intentional?! Come Jiggle Me, or shut me off!" with a fallback to just shutting off if I fell asleep or something.
