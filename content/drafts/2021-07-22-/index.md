Setup Low impact Permissions they are allowed to accept (like "view email address" and essentially account-verification permissions)

Change the User Consent to only allow Low Impact permissions without requesting approval.

Note: This won't affect existing approved permissions, so you may want to do an audit of those. I would suggest these as a starting point.
